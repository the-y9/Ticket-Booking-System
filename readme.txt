This is a Flask-based web application for managing a ticket booking system. The application allows users to sign up, log in, buy tickets for shows, and manage shows and administrators. Below is an overview of the project structure and its functionalities.

Project Structure:
- app.py: The main Flask application file containing routes and functions.
- templates/: Contains HTML templates used by the application.
- db.db: SQLite database file containing user, show, and booking data.
- used inline css.
- README.txt: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Getting Started:
1. Install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the application by executing `python app.py`.
3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.

Functionality Overview:
1. User Registration and Login:
   - Users can sign up with a unique username, password, and either email or phone number.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

Security Considerations:
- The application uses bcrypt for password hashing.
- The application employs basic authorization checks to restrict access to certain routes.
- However, the application could be improved by implementing more advanced security practices, such as using prepared statements and sanitizing user inputs.

Note:
- This application is intended for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use as-is.
- It's important to conduct security audits and further development before deploying it in a real-world scenario.
